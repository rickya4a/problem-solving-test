To determine balanced parentheses (opening and closing parentheses), we can use stacking. This approach ensures that each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order. The complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the string, since each character in the string is processed once. Each push and pop operation on the stack is O(1).

# Explanation
**Stacking Usage:**
A stack is used to keep track of the opening parenthesis.
For each opening parenthesis, it is inserted into the stack.
For each closing parenthesis, the algorithm checks whether the stack is empty (indicating a mismatched closing parenthesis) or if the top of the stack does not match the current closing parenthesis (indicating a mismatch).

**Matching Pairs:**
The `IsMatchingPair()` function checks whether the given pair of parentheses (opening parenthesis and closing parenthesis) are of the same type.

After processing all the characters, if the stack is empty, it means that all the opening parenthesis have matching closing parenthesis in the correct order, and the string is balanced.
If the stack is not empty, there is a mismatched opening parenthesis, and the string is not balanced.
